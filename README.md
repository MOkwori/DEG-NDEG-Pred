Datasets files
Each excel file contains the full dataset and dataset of all considered selections of the top and least differential and non differential genes, respectively. All the shaded columns provide some details of the experiment and gene, and only the unshaded columns are used at features in our models. The model features have been scaled to −0.5 to 0.5 to optimize the artificial neural network model. The data of the considered GLDS experiments can be downloaded from the GeneLab database at https://genelab.nasa.gov/ 

Supplementary file 1 — Results of feature selection analysis.
The excel file shows list of features in the dataset and the features selected in all the considered selections of the top and least differential and non differential genes. The features are ranked from the most informative to the least.

Supplementary file 2 — Results of gene ontology analysis.
The excel file shows the detailed results of the gene ontology analysis, with sheets containing the analysis for biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions for the correctly and incorrectly predicted genes.
